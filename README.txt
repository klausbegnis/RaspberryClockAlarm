Hello,

this is a pretty straightforward tutorial to make this clock works.

Firstly, be sure that the requirements are installed at you raspberry pi.
Then, start doing the circuits physical build.

PIN 11 - green led,
PIN 13 - yellow led,
PIN 15 - white led,
PIN 19 - on relay module

To your lamp light up, cut one of the sides of a common cable and screw them on the relay module,
a relay module is basically an switch/button but it only lets the eletrons flow if the magnet that
is inside isn't pulling a metal sheet by a magnetic field. There are plenty of tutorials in the internet
of how to make an simple extension for this purpose.
